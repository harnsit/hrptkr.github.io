Lead Technology

*	UMR (Unified Map Reduce) 
o	Framework supported seamless integration for multiple feeds and apps.
o	Developed a pluggable annotation framework for our data feeds.
o	Integrat	ing the URL Categorization library developed by research team into production.
o	Designed and coded in Java, Scala and Python. 
o	Tools: Hadoop, MapReduce and Oozie.
*	Bulk Stats Data Pipeline
o	Analysis of networking performance – Cisco Aggregated Service Routers (ASR).
o	Maintained a mapping of network type to schemas.
o	Output files were rows for multiple cubes with different dimensions.
o	After MR phase, another job published output to different InfiniDB tables.
o	Tools: Apache Spark
*	Report Framework
o	Reporting using BI tools – BIRT.
o	Outbound Roaming Report - Identification of subscriber data usage while roaming.
*	HDFS and Oozie Manager
o	Worked on design of service management layer for the Hadoop clusters.
o	Wrote monitoring and ping tests to verify connectivity of all nodes.
o	Planned and executed the upgrade to 2.4 – including data upgrade and standby name node.
o	Worked on HDFS issues with legacy clusters like data loss after addition of new data node.
o	DISTCP job for HDFS File Transfer – Designed and implemented Oozie job for HDFS file transfer.
o	Enabled file transfer workflow from 2.4 version to the legacy 0.20 using WebHDFS.
o	Extended Oozie 4.0 to make it highly available.
o	Oozie client CLI to trigger workflows and describe failed executions.
*	OAM
o	GMS - Developed an XML based configuration app to configure, bootstrap cluster and monitoring.
o	Earlier our product was deployed as an OS image. Worked on creating Reflex using RPMs over CentOS. Also managed the dependency tree and versioning.
o	Integrated Hive and Shark with GMS, configured the Metastore using PGSQL including schema management and tracking addition of latest output files on HDFS
o	NBI – North Bound Interface. GMS can be used to monitor KPIs at regular intervals. There values are stored in a backend database (PGSQL) by GMS. GMS fetches these values to present on a UI
o	Exported the data in a generic format so that it is available for others to process on demand.
o	Configured Zabbix and configuration management UI for LDAP auth support.
*	Collector
o	Initial design and development of multiple collector entities for the ingestion layer in C++
o	It parsed the incoming packets according to the given protocol and then dumped it to a suitable format
o	This system was required as direct save to HDFS had low throughput
